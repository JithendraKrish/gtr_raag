Welcome, This is my project Guitar Raag.
I belong to a music institute learning guitar, where i have been thought about Carnatic and Western music.
Carnatic and Western music is not entirely different there are many similarities and bridges, but at times it is very difficult to accompany a Carnatic music in western Vice versa..
The composers have to accurately calculate the music notations,  notes, distances, pitches to accompany the music in a harmonical way.
